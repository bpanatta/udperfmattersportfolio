## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

To optimize the Website Performance Optimization final project (Cameron's portfolio) I did the following:
* Inlined minified CSS from css/style.css
* Added media="print" to css/print.css call
* Minified css/print.css
* Inlined minified JS from js/perfmatters.js
* Minified Google Analytics API JS call and the already inlined JS code
* Optimized images
